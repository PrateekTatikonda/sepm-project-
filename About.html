                    Here at PC Part Picker or PCPP our founders, Filip Creydt and Andreas Nyström, operate with the mindset that everyone can build a computer, and we are dedicated to educate and
                    serve our customers. We have worked hard and for a long time building our empire from the ground up, this page is for you to see our journey through this companies life.

                <p>
                    We started in a garage, we rented it from Filip's uncle, Wong. 
                    We were broke and had to live inside the garage, 
                    the same place we operated from. 
                    For many years we built our own empire from nothing.

                    When our company finally got funding from the state, 
                    we could rent an office space instead of Filip's uncle's garage.
                    Because of our new space we could also hire more people.

                    Thanks to all of our workers and customers, we can now just sit back in our mansions,
                    and just let the empire grow by itself. 
                    Thank you all for visiting our website and wanting to engage with our services.
