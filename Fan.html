            A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling. 
            Fans are used to draw cooler air into the case from the outside, 
            expel warm air from inside and move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. 
            Both axial and sometimes centrifugal (blower/squirrel-cage) fans are used in computers. 
            Computer fans commonly come in standard sizes, and are powered and controlled using 3-pin or 4-pin fan connectors.

            Used to cool the CPU (central processing unit) heatsink. 
            Effective cooling of a concentrated heat source such as a large-scale integrated circuit requires a heatsink, 
            which may be cooled by a fan, use of a fan alone will not prevent overheating of the small chip.
