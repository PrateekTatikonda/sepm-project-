        <p>
            Random-access memory (or simply RAM) is the memory or information storage in a computer that is used to store running programs and data for the programs. 
            Data (information) in the RAM can be read and written quickly in any order. 
            Normally, the random access memory is in the form of computer chips. 
            Usually, the contents of RAM are accessible faster than other types of information storage but are lost every time the computer is turned off. 
            Non-volatile random-access memory (NVRAM) keeps its data without using power, 
            which is more expensive but works slower, so it is used in smaller amounts.
