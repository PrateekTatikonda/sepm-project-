            A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk or hard drive, is a data storage device for computers which uses magnetic storage to store data. 
            The capacity of a hard drive is usually measured in gigabytes (GB), 
            however hard disk capacity can also be measured in terabytes when the capacity is over 1000 gigabytes. 
            A gigabyte is one thousand megabytes and a megabyte is one million bytes, 
            which means that a gigabyte is one billion bytes. 
            Some hard drives are so large that their capacity is measured in terabytes, 
            (TB) where one terabyte is a thousand gigabytes (1 TB = 1024 GB).
            A solid-state drive (SSD) is a data storage device, typically used in a computer. 
            It uses flash memory to store data even after power is turned off. 
            SSDs are designed to access data in the same way as traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). 
            A HDD can usually be directly replaced with a SSD.
            The best thing about solid state drives is that they have a much faster read/write speed than hard disk drives. 
            They also have no moving parts, which means they don't make noise or break as easily. 
            However, SSDs are can be more expensive than a hard drive. This also means that for the same price, 
            someone can get much more capacity if they select a HDD instead.
