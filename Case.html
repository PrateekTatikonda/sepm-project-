            A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, tower, system unit, 
            CPU (when referring to the case as a whole rather than the processor), 
            or cabinet, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse). 
            Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC—steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil) or aluminium. 
            Plastic is sometimes used, and other materials such as glass, wood and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases.
            Cases can come in many different sizes (known as form factors). 
            The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard, 
            since it is the largest component of most computers. Consequently, 
            personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case. 
            Form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well, 
            since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.
